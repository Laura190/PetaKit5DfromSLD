%% demo to use our fast tiff/zarr readers and writers
% also include comparison with conventional ones
% 
% Note: the acceleration over conventional methods depends on the number of
% CPU cores in your system. In the paper, we benchmarked in a 24-core
% system. If your system has more cores, you may see even more accelerations. 
% However, if your system has fewer cores, the acceleration may be not as much 
% as we showed in the paper. 
%
% The parameters demonstrated here are usually a subset of those available 
% for the functions, with the rest using default values. For a comprehensive 
% list of parameters and their defaults, please see the function's parameter 
% list (or input parser) or refer to the parameter documentation (major_functions_documentation.txt).
